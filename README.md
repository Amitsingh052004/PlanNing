To achieve this project, first I would try to understand what the data.gov.in portal actually provides. I will explore the datasets available from the Ministry of Agriculture and IMD (India Meteorological Department), and also check how the data is stored like in CSV, Excel or JSON format. After that, using simple tools like Excel or python, I would download few sample datasets such as rainfall and crop production data. Then I will clean and combine the data by checking if all state names, years and formats are matching properly so that comparison can be done easily. Once that part is done, I would start analyzing the data to find simple answers like which state had more rainfall or which crop was produced more. I can use Excel charts or python codes for showing the results in visuals. Later, I will create a very simple web page where user can ask basic question and get result from the analysis. Since I am still learning, I will take help from online tutorials and youtube videos to understand how to clean data, connect APIs and make simple visuals. In future, I would like to make the system better by connecting it directly with live data from data.gov.in and maybe add small AI or chatbot features after I get more experience.
